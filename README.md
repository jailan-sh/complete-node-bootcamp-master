# Course Material and FAQ for my Complete Node.js, Express and MongoDB Bootcamp

This repo contains starter files and the finished project files for all the projects contained in the course (complete repo size is **288MB**).

Use starter code to start each section, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!

Plus, I made all the [course slides available for download](theory-lectures.pdf), to make it easier to follow along the theory videos.
